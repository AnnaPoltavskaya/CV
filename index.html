                        As an energetic novice in the field of QA, software testing sparks an interest in me. I desire to further my development in the IT field beyond my training to include experience beyond practical training. I have a natural curiosity, and appreciate problem sets with a desire to find organization within a complex situation. Inherently, I firmly believe that natural progress is dependent upon IT and the expanding technologies enhanced by it. Given this believe, I welcome an opportunity to experience this future as an active participant in the process. As aforementioned, this desire starts as an opportunity to obtain further experience with practical procedures. Beyond this, personal ambition causes me to look towards the future within this same field. My prior experience and natural character transitions directly to Project Management due to strong communication and organizational skills, and my inherent feeling of responsibility. I enjoy everything related to this task:  documentation, organization, charting, data optimization, communication with individuals across an organizational hierarchy. I thrive with this interactivity and a desire to complete objectives beyond the expectations of the client or stakeholder. This personal drive is what separates those individuals who simply meet demands with those who go beyond to actively engage within the process to excel within the field.
